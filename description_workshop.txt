Adds an upgraded void bag that combines functionality of the Void Bag and Portable Remote Storage Access, by putting items into a magic storage system when your inventory is full (and allowing remote access as usual).
This item is crafted by combining a Void Bag with a Portable Remote Storage Access. To link it with your storage system, right click the Storage Heart with the bag equipped.

Thanks to the original MagicStorage mod for some code and of course the functionality of the original mod!
