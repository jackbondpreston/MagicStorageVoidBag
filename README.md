# MagicStorageVoidBag

A mod that extends [Magic Storage](https://github.com/blushiemagic/MagicStorage).

Adds an upgraded void bag that combines functionality of the Void Bag and Portable Remote Storage Access, by putting items into a magic storage system when your inventory is full (and allowing remote access as usual).

This item is crafted by combining a Void Bag with a Portable Remote Storage Access. To link it with your storage system, right click the Storage Heart with the bag equipped.
